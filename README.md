# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and TypeScript.
The application showcases two versions of the game:

### useState Version
one using React useState for managing state  

### XState Version
another utilizing the XState library for state management.

### Styled Components
I used for the styles in my project Styled Components.

### Reusable Components
Reusable Components: Button and Container,
Includes container and button components that can be reused in other parts of the project.
I implemented global styles and a theme for consistent design.

### React Testing:
Basic tests have been written using React Testing Library, 
although this is my first time writing tests, and they are a work in progress.
This is my first time writing tests.

cd game-tic-tac-toe

To run the project:

### Notes
XState v5 requires TypeScript version 5.0 or greater. 
For best results, use the latest TypeScript version.

To update TypeScript to the latest version, you can run:
### `npm install typescript@latest`
