### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and TypeScript.
The application showcases two versions of the game:

### XState Version
another utilizing the XState library for state management.

### Styled Components

Includes container and button components that can be reused in other parts of the project.
I implemented global styles and a theme for consistent design.

although this is my first time writing tests, and they are a work in progress.
This is my first time writing tests.
